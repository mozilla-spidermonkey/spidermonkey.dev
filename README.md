# spidermonkey.dev

Static content for https://spidermonkey.dev/

This website is a landing page connecting to resources useful for people working on or with the Mozilla SpiderMonkey JavaScript Engine.

Note: Documentation itself should be kept in-tree when possible and linked to from here.

## Running locally

Ruby and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) must be installed. On Ubuntu the following
should work (replace $REPO_URL with the GitHub repository URL):

```
$ sudo apt-get install git ruby bundler zlib1g-dev
$ git clone $REPO_URL spidermonkey.dev
$ cd spidermonkey.dev
$ bundle install --path vendor # If this complains about Bundler version, see below.
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will start a webserver on localhost. It rebuilds the website in the background
when you update the markdown files.

If `bundle install` fails with an error about the Bundler version, do what it suggests,
for example:

```
$ gem install bundler:2.0.2
```

## Adding a new post

- Create an entry in `_posts`, with title layout of `YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown`
- Add a frontsmatter:

```
---
layout: post
title: "My Title"
date: 2021-05-03 09:30:00 +0700
---
```
