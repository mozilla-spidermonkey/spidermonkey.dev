# Welcome!

SpiderMonkey is Mozilla's JavaScript and WebAssembly Engine, used in
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Servo](https://servo.org/)
and [various](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/survey-where-are-you-embedding-spidermonkey/77988)
other projects. It is written in C++, Rust and JavaScript. You can embed it into [C++](https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/spidermonkey-embedding-examples) and [Rust](https://github.com/servo/mozjs) projects, and it can be run as a stand-alone shell. It can also be [compiled](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/making-javascript-run-fast-on-webassembly) to [WASI](https://wasi.dev/); see our online [demo](https://mozilla-spidermonkey.github.io/sm-wasi-demo/).
