# 71st meeting of Ecma TC39
# High-level overview

Stage 4, ready to ship:
Promise.allSettled [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1549176)
Two syntax changes have moved to stage 3, nullish coalescence and optional chaining
A lot of discussion around built in modules. No forward movement.
Issues with Weakref -- it cannot be tested in the current test262 setup. Discussion around how to address this.

#Editor Updates
## Test 262 report

Test262 is having problems with weak refs. It is difficult to detect problems because all of the browsers have different garbage collectors. We discussed the possibility of adding a GC hook for the tests, but it was discarded. There are also security implications. There was no clear resolution here, but it highlights an issue.

## TC53 Liaison Report

The liaison reported a change to the name
TC53: EcmaScript Modules for Embedded Systems

This highlights their support for builtin modules. They explicitly voiced their support for split namespaces, which Mozilla opposes.

# Accepted normative changes 

* Disallow internal methods returning `continue`|`break`|`return`
    * Assists formalisation and implementors
*  Disallow BigInt literals for Annex-B non-octal digits
    * Annex B was causing issues with the spec. It was not resolvable so we disable non-octal digits
