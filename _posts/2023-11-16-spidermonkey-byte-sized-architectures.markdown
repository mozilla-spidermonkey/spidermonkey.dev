I recently presented on SpiderMonkey and Byte-Sized Architectures at a
JSConf.jp/TC39 collaborative meeting the evening before the TC39 plenary
in Tokyo. The first part of the presentation is a high-level view of the
overall architecture of SpiderMonkey, and gives an idea of how a modern
JavaScript engine is put together. In the second part, I talk about
[bytesize architectures](https://bytesizearchitecturesessions.com/) a
way for teams to build a shared understanding of complicated systems.

The [slides](/assets/pdf/SpiderMonkey%20Byte-sized%20Architectures.pdf)
and a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4lp1sirkJg&t=1426s) are available.
